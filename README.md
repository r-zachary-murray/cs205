## Overview

Graph analytics, or network analysis, is an area of data analysis concerned with describing and investigating the relationships between data points. While many will think of its use for analysis of online social networks such as Facebook or Twitter, graph analytics can be used in a variety of domains: detecting fraud, identifying points of weakness in infrastructure networks like power or water grids, identifying key characters in narrative texts, analyzing road coverage, mapping the interaction between physiological systems like the heart and brain, etc. Thus, algorithms that create, traverse, and analyze graphs are helpful for a diverse set of problems.

To investigate how parallel computing can solve these challenges, we picked seven important graph algorithms to parallelize.
