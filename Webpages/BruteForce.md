# Brute Force Method

The brute force method simply calculates the distance between all particles in the simulation domain. If this distance is smaller than the particle radius the two particles are considered to have collided.


## Our Implementation

*Write a bit here

### Serial Benchmarking

*Do some basic stuff here verify O(n^2)
